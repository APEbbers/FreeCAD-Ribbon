To restore the ribbon after issues with FreeCAD's overlay function place a file "OVERLAY_DISABLED" in the folder of the add-on.
Normally is this something like ../mod/FreeCAD-Ribbon/
Make sure that the file has no extension!

To make it easy, There is already a file named OVERLAY_DISABLED.bak.
Just remove ".bak" from it and the ribbon will be restored on the next startup of FreeCAD.
